Problem Description

You are given an integer A. You have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.
Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.

Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 106



Input Format
First and only argument contains a single positive integer A.



Output Format
Return 1 if A is a perfect number and 0 otherwise.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = 4
Input 2:

A = 6


Example Output
Output 1:

0 
Output 2:

1 

Solution:

import math
class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        sum=0
        if A==1:
            return 0
        for i in range(1,A):
            if A%i==0:
                sum+=i
        if sum==A:
            return 1
        else:
            return 0
