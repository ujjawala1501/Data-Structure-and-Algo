# Problem Description
Given an array A of N integers. Count the number of elements that have at least 1 elements greater than itself.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109


Input Format
First and only argument is an array of integers A.


Output Format
Return the count of elements.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = [3, 1, 2]
Input 2:
A = [5, 5, 3]


Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:
1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
The elements that have at least 1 element greater than itself are 1 and 2
Explanation 2:
The elements that have at least 1 element greater than itself is 3

Solution:

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        #FIND max element first 
        max_el=A[0]
        N=len(A)
        for i in range(1,len(A)):
            if max_el<A[i]:
                max_el=A[i]
        #Once found max element count it then substract from total number of elements in the list
        #that will give number of smaller values
        count=0
        for j in range(len(A)):
            if max_el ==A[j]:
                count+=1
        return N-count
