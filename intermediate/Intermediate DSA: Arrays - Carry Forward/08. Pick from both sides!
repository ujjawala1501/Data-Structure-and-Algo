Problem Description
You are given an integer array A of size N.
You have to perform B operations. In one operation, you can remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array A.
Find and return the maximum possible sum of the elements that were removed after B operations.

NOTE: Suppose B = 4, and array A contains 10 elements, then
You can remove the first four elements or can remove the last four elements, or can remove 1 from front and 3 from the back, etc. You need to return the maximum possible sum of elements you can remove.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= B <= N
-103 <= A[i] <= 103

Input Format
First argument is an integer array A.
Second argument is an integer B.

Output Format
Return an integer denoting the maximum possible sum of elements you removed.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [5, -2, 3 , 1, 2]
 B = 3

Input 2:
 A = [ 2, 3, -1, 4, 2, 1 ]
 B = 4

Example Output
Output 1:
 8

Output 2:
 9


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Remove element 5 from front and element (1, 2) from back so we get 5 + 1 + 2 = 8

Explanation 2:
 Remove the first element and the last 3 elements. So we get 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 9
 
 SOLUTION:
 class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A, B):
        front_sum = 0
        for i in range(B):
            front_sum+=A[i]
            ans = front_sum
        n = len(A)
        for i in range(B):
            front_sum-=A[B-1-i]
            front_sum+=A[n-1-i]
            ans = max(ans, front_sum)
        return ans
