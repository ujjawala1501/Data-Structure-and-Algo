Problem Description
There are A people standing in a circle. Person 1 kills their immediate clockwise neighbour and pass the knife to the next person standing in circle. This process continues till there is only 1 person remaining. Find the last person standing in the circle.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 105


Input Format
First argument A is an integer.


Output Format
Return an integer.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = 4
Input 2:
A = 5


Example Output
Output 1:
1
Output 2:

3


Example Explanation
For Input 1:
Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then the person at position 4 is killed,
then the person at position 3 is killed. So the person at position 1 survives. 
For Input 2:
 
Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then the person at position 4 is killed, 
then the person at position 1 is killed. Finally, the person at position 5 is killed. 
So the person at position 3 survives.

SOLUTION:
class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        i = 1
        while(i <= A):
            i *= 2                                         #Here i value will become 16 and then only it'll break but we need (2)^3 8<=9
            ans = ((A - i//2) * 2) + 1       #That's why we're dividing i by 2 to get the previous value
        return ans                              # So (A - 2^n) * 2 (steps) + 1
