Problem Description

Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to B together.
Note: It is possible to swap any two elements, not necessarily consecutive.



Problem Constraints

1 <= length of the array <= 100000
-109 <= A[i], B <= 109



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer B.



Output Format

Return the minimum number of swaps.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [1, 12, 10, 3, 14, 10, 5]
 B = 8
Input 2:

 A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
 B = 20


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 A = [1, 12, 10, 3, 14, 10, 5]
 After swapping  12 and 3, A => [1, 3, 10, 12, 14, 10, 5].
 After swapping  the first occurence of 10 and 5, A => [1, 3, 5, 12, 14, 10, 10].
 Now, all elements less than or equal to 8 are together.
Explanation 2:

 A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
 After swapping 100 and 11, A => [5, 17, 11, 100].
 Now, all elements less than or equal to 20 are together.
 

SOLUTION:
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A, B):
    # Find count of elements
    # which are less than
    # equals to k
        n=len(A)
        count = 0
        for i in range(0, n) :
            if (A[i] <= B) :
                count = count + 1
        
        # Find unwanted elements
        # in current window of
        # size 'count'
        bad = 0
        for i in range(0, count) :
            if (A[i] > B) :
                bad = bad + 1
        
        # Initialize answer with
        # 'bad' value of current
        # window
        ans = bad
        j = count
        for i in range(0, n) :
            
            if(j == n) :
                break
                
            # Decrement count of
            # previous window
            if (A[i] > B) :
                bad = bad - 1
            
            # Increment count of
            # current window
            if (A[j] > B) :
                bad = bad + 1
            
            # Update ans if count
            # of 'bad' is less in
            # current window
            ans = min(ans, bad)
    
            j = j + 1
    
        return ans
