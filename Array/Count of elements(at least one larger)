 Problem description:
 
 Given an array A of N integers. Count the number of elements that have at least 1 elements greater than itself.

 SOLUTION:
 
    def solve(self, A):
        #FIND max element first 
        max_el=A[0]
        N=len(A)
        for i in range(1,len(A)):
            if max_el<A[i]:
                max_el=A[i]
        #Once found max element count it then substract from total number of elements in the list
        #that will give number of smaller values
        count=0
        for j in range(len(A)):
            if max_el ==A[j]:
                count+=1
        return N-count
